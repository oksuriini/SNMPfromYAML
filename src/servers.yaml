switches:
  # Use whatever name you want. This is purely metadata
  # - name: "SW-25"
  # IP address has to be correct
  #   ip_address: "172.30.133.25"
  # Use community string that this specific switch has
  #   community_string: "public"
  # Use port count based on basic interfaces + uplink interfaces
  #   port_count: 24

  - name: "SW-TESTI"
    ip_address: "172.30.133.159"
    community_string: "public"
    port_count: 24

oids:
  # Name is purely metadata
  - name: "Ports"
    # Descriptor is good for documentation purposes. Still metadata.
    # Good idea to tell here to which switches this is designated to
    description: "Scan all the interfaces of the switch. HP Procurve 2626"
    # OID has to match
    # If OID is parent to many children and it's iterable,
    # use the parent and then set iterable to true state
    # Otherwise just use the oid you want to seek and set iterable to false state
    oid: "1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.7"
    # Set this to true or false based on if the oid is iterable
    iterable: true
